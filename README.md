# PacManAI
Pac-man is a traditional video game that has been popular for decades. The player controls Pac-Man through a maze, eating pac-dots or pellets. When all pac-dots are eaten, Pac-Man is taken to the next stage. The project aims at developing computer AI algorithms to play the pac-man game, either on its own, or compete with alternative AI implementations as well as human players.
